numpy is a package that defines multydimensional array:
1. It also has packages for working in domainons of leniar algebra Fourier Transformation and Matrix

==> ARRAY\
1. definded as a collection of items thata are stored at contiguous memeory location 
2.It is a contaioner which can hold a fix number of items and of same type
3. A combination of array saves a lot fo time an array can reduce a lot of time

eg of array : import numpy'
              arr = numpy.array([1,2,3,4,5])

4. numpy uses much less memory to store data 
5. numpy makes it much more easy to preform mathematical operatons on it
6. used for creation of n-dimensional array
7. finding element in nympy array is easy


Arrays V/S list
1. list cannot directly handel mathematical operation while array can do 
2. an array consumes less memeory then list
3. Using an arrya is faster then list
4. A list can store different data types while an array can store only one type of data
5. a list is easire to modefy as it store each elements individualy it is easire to add or delete an element form a list as compared to array 
6. In list one can have nested data with different types while you cannot do the same in array


CREATING AN ARRAY : 
ARRAY = numpy.array([list])
# numpy.arange() function creates an array of evenly spaced values within a given interval. It is similar to Pythonâ€™s built-in range() function but returns a NumPy array instead of a list.
# numpy.arange(start, stop, step)
arr = np.arange(1,10,0.5)
print(arr)            \-> o.5   hear represent that the array will be of type float

# Combining a conditional filtering :
filtered = arr[arr%2==0]
print(filtered)


ATTRIBUTES OF THE ARRAY IS GIVEN BY : 
ndarray.shape retuns the tuple conating the size of the array
ndarray.ndim return the dimension of the array
ndarray.size returns the total number of the elements of the array
ndaray.dtype returns the data type of the array
